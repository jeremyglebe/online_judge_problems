### Virtual Judge

Virtual Judge is a website which allows you to submit code to solve problems
from various other online judges. Because there are so many online judges and
problem sets, it can become very inconvienent to manage separate accounts for
each. Virtual Judge allows you to use one account to submit your solutions
to problems and track your stats.

Virtual Judge can be found here: https://vjudge.net/
